# ping-pong-web-app

- Yes I know the name needs work

Here is the actual code for our Web App.  We're going to start small with all of our code consolidated into a Spring Boot Application.

Therefore all Server-side java code, and client-side HTML/CSS/Javascript will be here

This app is designed to be relatively simple at first, while we ge the infracturcture and CI/CD sorted out, we can then add more functionality

### The Tech stack

Server side should be Java 8 and Spring to start out with, but apart from that, add whatever dependencies you want

Client side has more freedom:

- can do whatever as long as some semblance of structure is maintained,
- Angular would make the most sense, but what do I know
- If people are really curious I'm fine with implemting in ECMAScript 6 or 7

### Current goals

- Display list of ping pong scores, and relevant statistical data
    - We'll start with reading through the app, then writing
- Do this securely via HTTPS

Future goals (To be implemented after CI/CD and infrasture are solid, this an AWS learning activity after all)

- separate Services from Presentation

- Look into a completely serverless model (microservices via AWS Lambda)

- Be hipster as fuck and write in Ruby and Node.js
